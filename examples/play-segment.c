	//    the new segment as to not interrupt the flow of music. The options are "instant", which ignores all
	//    that and immediately plays the segment, "grid" which plays the segment at the next possible beat
	//    subdivision, "beat" which plays the segment at the next beat and "measure" which plays it at the next
